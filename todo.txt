snomed is-a subsets should come from snomed instead of fhir page
(manifestation, exposure route, substance, maybe others)

maybe make CodeableConcept model with a binding and coding set
the point of the extra model would be to have that exact ManyToManyField coding only once

patient form with modelform

observation Focus field should reference any FHIR resource

add bindings for observation



clinician preferences:
allergy vs intolerance? seperate or filter? https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1i4hle2/what_is_the_most_ridiculous_allergy_youve_seen_a/m7v9tyo/

easy to not find FHIR_GP_Quantity_Duration

autocomplete on type
fill out all fields

run SaveCodingsToDB.py when first creating database
form to add new allergy
maybe dont save whole allergy unless whole thing validates
flash on save?
allergy form doesnt do tom select on save? also not sure validation/saving works with some models not existing
navbar when resizing...

schedule appts
register patient
patient search
patient lists

order medication
outpatient medication list
problem list
family history
growth chart
immunizations

between module dependencies:
calendar -> appointment, because calendar links to specific encounter
    the model relation is encounter has many appointments, although we only need one appointment ref
    so when creating encounter, use appointment and its location/status
    for now, going to say when you click on an appointment, it either gets first associated encounter or creates new encounter

dark mode switcher doesn't work after clicking patient pages, something with idiomorph replacement maybe
putting None in login default instead of blank
error in calendar if appointment has no patient subject - should maybe set patient none gracefully
back button broken when calendar -> double click appointment

^some of these codes aren't like a | b | c

add __str__ to models manually idk

chart review (encounters, notes, labs, imaging), growth, pre chart, immunizations, history/ core review, summaries, visit checklist, problem list, notes
